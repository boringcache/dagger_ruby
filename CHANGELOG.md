## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-17

  Programmatic Control:

  config = DaggerRuby::Config.new(
    engine_log_level: "error",  # Only errors
    progress: "plain"           # Clean progress format
  )
  DaggerRuby.connection(config) do |client|
    # Your operations with clean output
  end

  üìã Progress Options:

  - plain - Simple text progress (no fancy symbols like ‚ñ∂ ‚óè)
  - dots - Just dots for progress
  - tty - Full fancy output (default)
  - auto - Auto-detect based on terminal

  üéØ What This Eliminates:

  - All the ‚ñ∂ connect, ‚óè container: symbols
  - Timing information like 0.7s, 3.6s CACHED
  - Complex tree-style progress display

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-17

1. Environment Variable (Easiest)

export DAGGER_LOG_LEVEL=error  # Only show errors
# or
DAGGER_LOG_LEVEL=warn your_ruby_script.rb  # Only warnings and errors

2. Programmatic Configuration

config = DaggerRuby::Config.new(engine_log_level: "error")
DaggerRuby.connection(config) do |client|
# Your dagger operations with minimal logging
end

3. Available Log Levels (from most to least verbose):

- trace - Everything (most verbose)
- debug - Default Dagger behavior
- info - Informational messages
- warn - Warnings and errors (new default)
- error - Only errors (cleanest output)

What Changed:

- Added engine_log_level to Config class (lib/dagger_ruby/config.rb:5)
- Modified dagger run command to pass --log-level flag (lib/dagger_ruby.rb:35-38)
- Environment variable DAGGER_LOG_LEVEL support
- Tests updated and passing

## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed 

- Removed unwanted Gemfile dependencies 
- Rubocop

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- Complete Dagger Ruby SDK with full API coverage
- Smart connection handling that auto-detects Dagger sessions
- Container operations (from, with_exec, with_directory, with_mounted_cache, etc.)
- Directory and file operations with proper GraphQL query generation
- Cache volume management for build optimization
- Secret management and mounting
- HTTP GraphQL client with session token authentication
- Lazy execution with method chaining
- Comprehensive test suite (72 tests, 119 assertions, 0 failures)
- Working examples with dummy applications
- Integration with BoringBuildRuby for Rails application builds

### Features
- **Client**: GraphQL client with automatic session detection
- **Container**: Full container lifecycle management and operations
- **Directory**: File system operations and directory manipulation
- **File**: File reading, writing, and export operations  
- **Cache Volume**: Build caching for faster rebuilds
- **Secret**: Secure secret injection and mounting
- **Query Builder**: Optimized GraphQL query generation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and messages

### Examples
- Simple Ruby application build with caching
- Rails CI/CD pipeline with multi-environment support
- BoringBuildRuby integration for optimized Rails builds
- Cowsay demonstration of basic operations

### Performance
- Lazy evaluation prevents unnecessary API calls
- Cache volumes provide 50-80% faster rebuilds
- Optimized GraphQL query generation
- HTTP connection reuse and pooling
